Pushover Notification for Check_MK
==================================

This is my script for sending Pushover notifications (http://pushover.net) from my Check_MK monitoring system.

Add this to your check_mk/notifications directory and make sure it's executable.
Pushover needs a User & Application API key. Save the user's key in the Pager address field. Set the application key as the first parameter in the flexible notifications config.

Better setup instructions coming soon...
